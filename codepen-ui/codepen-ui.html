                The First WORD
            </h2>

        </label>
        <p>"The Dogon say that the stars were created from pellets of earth flung out into space by the one true god, Amma. The Sun and Moon were created by a process much like that of making pottery, which was the first known invention of the god. To create the Earth, Amma squeezed a lump of clay in his hand and threw it away from himself in the same manner as he did the stars.<br>By nature, the Earth is female. In the course of time, Amma tried to fertilize her, but in what was a breach of order in the universe, proper intercourse could not take place... Later, having overcome the difficulty, Amma had intercourse with the Earth again, this time successfully. Water, which is the divine seed, entered the womb of the Earth and resulted in the birth of twins. These half human, half serpent spirits were called Nummo, and they were born perfect. They were of divine essence, which is the life force of the world, and is water. The name Nummo is synonymous in the Dogon language with the word for water.<br>The Nummo twins represent the ideal unit. When the Nummo looked down at the Earth and saw it unclothed and speechless, they decided to put an end to the disorder and confusion. They came down to Earth, bringing with them the fibers of plants created in heaven. From these fibers they created the first garment, which was made of two strands of ten fibers. The way the fibers hung in spiraling coils was symbolic of the water of tornadoes and hurricanes. The fibers themselves were reminiscent of the sun, which dries up moisture, and were also like the speech of the Nummo, which comes out in a warm vapor of water, the sound of which tapers off in spiraling coils. In this sense, the moisture of the words of the Nummo was transferred to the fibers of the garment. This fiber skirt was called The First WORD." <br>- <em>The Pale Fox</em> by Griaule & Dieterlan <br>

            For the Dogon, the concept of the WORD did in fact refer to literal speech and language. With this in mind, they also use it figuratively to described the process of instruction on and acquistion of civilizing skills... So the concept of clothing is the "First WORD" in the language of civilized beings across the cosmos. Clothing is a "<s>necessary</s>EVIL", the first evolutionary/technological advancement given to help primal humanity recognize and overcome its nihilistic base nature. This is what ultimately paved the way for modern man to become the most imaginative, intuitive, intelligent, yet insidious species on the planet.
