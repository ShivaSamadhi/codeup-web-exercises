      Padmasambhava is commonly known as the second Buddha that transmitted early tantric buddhist thought from India to Tibet, during the 8th century CE. He is credited with starting the oldest of the Tibetan buddhist schools, and also with the authorship of the <em>Bardo Thodol</em>, Tibetan Book of the Dead. A figure that is steeped in legend and controversy, Padmasambhava (literally translated as <em>"lotus born"</em>) was said to have appeared as a fully developed young child from a lotus blossom. Along with his consorts Princess Mandarava and Yeshe Tsogyal, Padmasambhava spent most of his time in Tibet subduing and converting the antagonistic spirits of the land, or hiding celestial spiritual treasures and texts for future blessed souls to discover and use to uplift the consciousness of humanity.
