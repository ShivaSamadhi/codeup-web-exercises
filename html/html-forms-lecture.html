<!--The method attribute of a form element refers to the HTTP method that should be used to transmit the form data.
If no method is specified, by default, the GET method will be used.
While other HTTP methods exist, the html specification limits us to using GET and POST in forms.

*HTTP GETs* are used to request information, without making any changes to data on the server.
When a form's method is set to GET, any of the data that the form sends will be appended to the url in the form of a query string.
A query string is composed of key-value pairs. It begins with a question mark (?). Following the question mark, is the first key-value pair.
Key-value pairs are structured as key=value. Key-value pairs after the first will be separated by ampersands (&).

*HTTP POSTs* are used to make a change to existing data on the server.
When a form's method is set to POST, any of the data that the form sends will not be added to the url,
but will instead be embedded in the body of the HTTP request as key-value pairs.-->
<form method="POST" action="https://request-inspector.glitch.me/">
<!--The action attribute of an HTML form refers to the location that the form data should be sent.
If no action is specified, by default, the action will be set to send data back to the current url.-->
  <label for="username">Username</label>
  <input id="username" name="username" type="text">
    <!--Form inputs are what define the actual data that goes along with the form submission.
    While there are several types of inputs a form can contain, they all share some common characteristics.

    Basic text input element is an input element with a type of text.
    Textarea elements can be used for longer text input. Unlike inputs, a textarea is not a void element.

    Input elements with a type of either radio or checkbox. Multiple elements relating to the same question should share a name attribute.
    Commonly placed inside label elements.

    Select elements create a drop-down of choices. Consists of option elements for each choice.
    The contents of an option element are what the user sees, and the value attribute is the data is submitted as part of the form.
    The parent select element has a name attribute, and child option elements have value attributes.

  <!--In order for an input to be submitted, it must have a name attribute.
  The value of the name attribute will become the name of the key that corresponds to the value of the current input.-->

  <input type="submit">
  <!--In order to submit a form, the form must contain either a button, or input element, with a type attribute whose value is "submit".-->
  <!--Because inputs are void elements, using a button element will give us a little more flexibility with styling the form.-->
