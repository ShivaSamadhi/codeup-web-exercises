<!--HTML uses elements to describe the data in a web document.
These elements help give meaning and context to information being displayed.
All elements begin with an opening tag that is the name of the element inside of angle brackets (< and >).
All elements end with a closing tag, which is the name of the element preceded by a /, also inside of angle brackets.-->
